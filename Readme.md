# Fractal

## Compile and Run

This project has LWJGL as a dependency. LWJGL is a java Graphics library. `lwjgl.jar` and `lwjgl_util.jar` are required, as well as native libraries. The program can be executed (but not easily compiled) without these dependencies, but GPU computation will not be available in this case. To use the `run.cmd` file, set the correct paths to the jars and native library files of LWJGL.
