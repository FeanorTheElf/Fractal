# Fractal

## Compile and Run

This project has two dependencies:
- SimonUtil - a small utility library, written by myself. The jar is included in the project
- LWJGL - a java Graphics library. `lwjgl.jar` and `lwjgl_util.jar` are required, as well as native libraries. The program can be executed (but not easily compiled) without these dependencies, but GPU computation will not be available in this case.
